# Submerged

A text-based escape/adventure game written in Prolog.

## Story

You wake up alone in a rapidly sinking submarine, abandoned by the rest of the crew. There is no power, you are almost out of breathable air and enemy subs patrol the area. Can you escape to the surface before time runs out?
