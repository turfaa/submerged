## Prologue

You wake up alone on the cold, hard metal floor of your sub's weapons room. Your head still hurts from the impact of the explosion before. You tried to slowly stand up, grabbing the pipes on the sides of the room. Seawater is trickling down from leaks at the wall and pooling to the front. Only then you realized that the sub is pointing at at angle downwards, and is probably still sinking deeper and deeper. You know that you don't have much time to escape to the surface.

## Weapons' room

You are in the weapons room, at the bow of the sub. Only the faint red glow of the emergency fluorescent lighting remains. The impact of the explosion has dislodged the stored weapons, which are now scattered on the floor. (Barrels blocked the exit hatch.)

## Sonar room

You entered the sonar room. (The sonar display is powered off./The sonar display emits a faint blue glow.) There's a ladder that leads to the airlock upwards, through a closed hatch. Another closed hatch leads to the crew quarters below. A passage opens to the control room in the back.

## Airlock

You opened the airlock inner hatch. Streams of saltwater falls through; though not much. The airlock chamber is wet. Seawater is slowly leaking from the outer hatch above, which leads outside. There are the remains of used emergency survival equipment on the floor; the others must have already escaped through here.

## Crew quarters

The crew quarters is where the crew rests when not on duty. A hatch to the back connects it with the storage room; a door to the front connects it to the wardroom. There's a ladder to the sonar room above.

## Wardroom

The captain and senior officers are stationed in the wardroom. Classified documents and manuals are usually kept here. A door opens to the crew quarters behind.

## Storage room

Food, equipment and supplies are kept in the storage room. A hatch connects it with the crew quarters in front.

## Control room

You entered the control room. The sub's computerized control and communication systems are mostly located here. Various displays and gauges can be seen on the wall. A console can be used to interact with the sub's control AI. A periscope mast is located near the center of the room.  A hatch opens to the back, to the engine room. A passage leads forward to the sonar room.

## Engine room

The engine room houses the forward part of the sub's reactor and engines. This room is where engineers control the ship's power-generating reactors. A hatch leads to the control room in front. Another hatch leads backwards, to the rear part of the reactor at the stern of the sub; but pressure gauges indicate that the reactor room is flooded.

## Reactor

The reactor is flooded and heavily damaged. Its metal parts were torn apart. The hull has been sliced through; a gaping hole opens to the outside. (However, bent frames and metal pipes are blocking your way. You need to somehow clear the way by force to pass through and go outside.)

## Surface

You finally escaped from the doomed sub, and ascend slowly to the surface in your emergency diving equipment. You reach the surface. The sky is clear, and moonlight reflected off the somewhat calm sea, dotted with specks of oil and floating debris from the destroyed vessels. In the distance, you see enemy ships sailing past the border. The war has just started.

## Document 2

[ Protocol concerning vessel self-destruction ]

In an emergency situation, the captain of the vessel may order the crew to abandon vessel. In this event, the crew must ensure the destruction of the vessel after their evacuation to prevent classified information and technology from being salvaged by the enemy; especially if the vessel is carrying classified documents or equipment. For this purpose, explosive charges have been installed at the bow of the ship. A security code is required to arm the timed fuzes on these charges.

The security code for NSV Glasgow's self-destruction explosives is 524323.

This information must be kept secure at all times. Only the captain and the senior officer may have access to this document to prevent sabotage.

## Document 3

[ Memo on #008 - Canterbury Active Defense System ]

NSV Glasgow has been fitted with a prototype active defense system, codename Canterbury. Although it has not yet been thoroughly field-tested, High Command insisted that this system be fitted as soon as possible due to the high risk of an impending conflict. This AI-controlled energy-based defense system is able to automatically detect and neutralize threats in a 100 metre radius around the ship. The exact workings are highly classified.

As this system emits a significant amount of easily detectable electromagnetic pulses, it is advisable to only activate this system when the sub is already detected by the enemy and is under attack.

Its control system is directly linked to the sub's control AI. Only the captain may authorize its use; the activation code is 293441.

## Radio

Radio: High Command to NSV Glasgow, please respond.

(Player respond)

Radio: We have received your distress signal. Per evacuation protocol, you are ordered to destroy the sub to prevent sensitive information and equipment from being salvaged by the enemy by arming the sub's self-destruct explosives.

[ Secondary objective: arm explosives to self-destruct the sub ]

Radio: Our radar has also detected several enemy ships turning back to your location. Evacuate immediately.
